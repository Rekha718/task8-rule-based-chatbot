├── chatbot.py     # Main chatbot script
└── README.md      # Documentation
```

## How to Run
1. Open terminal or IDE.  
2. Run the script:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```
3. Chat with the bot by typing messages.  
4. Type **`bye`** to exit the conversation.

## Key Concepts
- Control flow: `if-elif-else` statements  
- Loops: `while True` for continuous input  
- Input handling: `input()` function  
- Case-insensitive comparison: `lower()` method
